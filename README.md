## ‚ú® Features
- **Programmable Voice Flows**: Design advanced call logic using declarative JSON-based Flows with branching, loops, forking, and post-call hooks
- **SMS & Messaging Flows**: Handle incoming and outgoing messages using the same flow engine. Enables surveys, notifications, and chatbot replies.
- **Extension Management**: Register SIP/WebRTC clients, assign extensions, and route calls to the right agent, queue, or flow.
- **Call Queues & Agent Management**: Create call queues with priority rules, agent login/logout, ring strategies, and call wait handling.
- **Outbound Campaigns**: Launch bulk voice or SMS campaigns via API or UI. Campaigns can use flows to automate actions per call/message.
- **Multitenancy & Customer Isolation**: Full tenant separation with isolated configurations, flows, agents, and access control. Designed for SaaS CPaaS scenarios.
- **Conferencing & Moderation Tools**: Host secure, real-time audio conferences with recording, breakout rooms, and moderator roles.
- **Chat & Web Messaging**: Support real-time messaging between customers and agents. Designed for seamless web or mobile integration.
- **AI-Powered Voice**: Integrate chatbot flows that understand user input, trigger smart actions, and provide fallback TTS messaging.
- **Real-time Transcription**: Transcribe speech on the fly or after the call, optionally summarized via AI with customizable flow triggers.
- **Call Recording**: Record conversations, generate transcripts, and summarize content using post-call flow execution.
- **Webhook & HTTP Integration**: Trigger webhooks mid-call or post-call, and dynamically adjust flows based on real-time external responses.
- **Flexible Flow Execution**: Use fork, next_action_id, and conditionals to model real-world conversation logic. Async execution supported.
- **Codec & Media Control**: SRTP, OPUS, PCMU, PCMA support via RTPEngine. Transcoding minimized for low-latency audio.
- **Secure Registration & Authentication**: Digest auth for SIP/WebRTC, token-based auth for API, tenant-based access segregation.
- ... And more and more!

## üì¶ Components

VoIPBIN is composed of microservices designed to work together or independently:

- `monorepo`: backend service monorepo
- `voipbin-go` ‚Äî Official Go SDK for developers

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Get Started

> ‚ö†Ô∏è VoIPbin is not a plug-and-play application.
> 
> It's a platform composed of multiple microservices, SIP/media infrastructure (e.g., Asterisk, RTPEngine), Kubernetes-based deployments, and cloud integrations (e.g., Twilio, OpenAI). You don't just "run it" ‚Äî you assemble and deploy it based on your architecture.

This monorepo handles only part of voipbin services.

![VoIPBin Architecture](architecture_overview_all.png)

That said, here's how to begin:

### Understand the Architecture

VoIPbin is composed of multiple services that run independently and communicate over HTTP, gRPC, SIP, and WebRTC. You‚Äôll need:

* A Kubernetes environment (we recommend GCP GKE)
* Compute engine with static public IP Address
* A public domain with TLS (e.g., via Cloudflare)
* A media path (RTPEngine or equivalent)
* Optionally, Asterisk instances for call bridging, conferencing, and SIP registration

We recommend reading the platform architecture guide (coming soon) before setup.

### Clone the Repo

```
   $ git clone https://github.com/your-org/voipbin.git
   $ cd voipbin
```

### Configure Your Secrets

```
export CC_AUTHTOKEN_OPENAI=xxx
export CC_TWILIO_TOKEN=xxx
export CC_SSL_CERT_API_BASE64=xxx
...
```
Check each service's README (or environment loader) for what it needs.

### Deploy to Kubernetes
You'll need a Kubernetes manifest or Helm chart per service. For now, these are maintained privately or in internal repositories ‚Äî contact us if you'd like access to deployment blueprints.

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please open an issue or submit a pull request.

For larger changes, create a discussion or proposal beforehand.
